    <p>There have been at least 90 laws attempting to restrict or outright ban abortion already in 2021 from those within the pro-life movement, via <a href='https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2021/07/state-policy-trends-midyear-2021-already-worst-legislative-year-ever-us-abortion' target='_blank'>a report</a> from the Guttmacher Institute. </p>
    
    <p>How do we define pro-life? This was a common utterance amongst rally-goers on Saturday, October 2nd in Brooklyn Heights, as people in favor of increased abortion access called into question the pro-life movement.</p>
    
    <p>The ‘March for Abortion Access’ was one of many that took place across the country. All of the marches that took place were sponsored by a coalition of over 120 civil rights organizations. The New York City marches all met in the five respective boroughs before joining together in Foley Square early in the afternoon Saturday to come together as one.  
    </p>

    <p>When speaking with New York City Council’s District 40 Candidate Kenya Handy-Hilliard, she touched on some of the recent bills passed that restrict access to abortion access.

    <p>Abortion being a matter of women's healthcare was highlighted. A <a href='https://www.colorado.edu/today/2021/09/08/study-banning-abortion-would-boost-maternal-mortality-double-digits' target='_blank'>recent study</a> out of University of Colorado Boulder found that banning abortion would lead to a 21% increase in the number of pregnancy-related deaths overall.</p>

    <p>“I should be able to say what happens in my womb, and not some people who are up in a tower making legislative decisions about my body,” she said.</p>

    <p>The march would have been easy to confuse for a rally given the many speakers and performances. The all womens marching band Fogo Azul kicked off proceedings, followed by speaker after speaker stepping up to the makeshift podium situated on the front of the William Jay Gaynor statue. The loudest roar of the early afternoon came when New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams grabbed the megaphone. </p>

    <p>“I reclaim the term pro-life! I reclaim it!” Williiams shouted.</p>

    <p>Public Advocate Williams, who recently announced the formation of an exploratory committee in anticipation for a Governor candidacy, went on to give a speech. Williams proclaimed that in order to be sufficiently pro-life, one must guarantee that the basic needs be met of a child and their parents.</p>

    <p>The march organizers were Brooklyn residents Carah Cronin-Fink and Samantha Attaguile. Both organizers and crowd seemed to give few utterances to the latest Texas Abortion Bill. There was an effort to highlight the need for a larger shift in focus towards future legislative decisions. Attaguile, a former opera singer, emphasized that she saw this as a pivotal moment.</p>
   
    <div class="icon">
        <i class="fa fa-balance-scale" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    </div> <p>“The Supreme Court is hearing a case in early December Dobbs vs. Jackson Women’s Health… about banning abortions after fifteen weeks in Mississippi. Which is a straight-up violation of Roe… and we need Roe v. Wade to be federally protected.”</p>
    
    <p>In spite of 67 percent of Americans supporting Roe v. Wade per a Kaiser Family Foundation <a href='https://www.kff.org/health-reform/press-release/poll-two-thirds-of-americans-dont-want-the-supreme-court-to-overturn-roe-v-wade/' target='_blank'>poll</a>, the challenges keep coming.

    <p>As the morning went along, the crowd in the plaza swelled to nearly spill out onto the edge of the street. As the speakers came and went, and the collective headed over the Brooklyn Bridge, it would have been easy to think that this was a group of seasoned protesters. Organizer Carah Cronin-Fink made sure to negate this assumption.</p>

    <p>“I am a designer and mother and never done anything like this before,” Cronin-Fink said.</p>
 <div class="icon">
        <i class="fa fa-child" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    </div>
    
    <p>States where these abortion bans are being passed, also have some of the worst <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/infant_mortality_rates/infant_mortality.htm' target='_blank'>infant mortality rates</a>, per the CDC.</p>

    <p>Cronin-Fink finished off by adding, “I don’t have the solutions, but I just know that they are not working… and I don’t want my daughter growing up in the world that is now.”</p>
